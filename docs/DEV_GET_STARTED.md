# Quick get started for developers of Lodger API

Please check this API's intention file before reading any further:

The API is meant to do the following:

## Tools and walkthrough

We use [Jest testing framework](https://jestjs.io) to test our codebase.

1. Running `yarn` inside the project directory will have this and almost all other required tools installed.

1. To run __all__ tests:

```sh
jest
```

To run an individual object test:

```sh
jest Taxonomy
```

1. Build

```sh
yarn build
```
